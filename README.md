Data Analysis with Python:

Python Challenge:

This challenge contains 2 analysis for 2 different data sets. The first analysis, titled PyBank, deals with analyzing financial records for a company and producing a summary of findings. The second analysis, titled PyPoll, using election results to find how many votes were cast for each candidate and determine the winner of the election.

Methods Used:

- Importing csv files
- Reading/writing to various file formats
- Storing content in variables, lists, and dictionaries
- Iterating through data structures
- Debugging code

Technology Used:

- Python

Project Description:

PyBank:
Using a csv file containing 87 rows and 2 columns: Date and Profit/Losses of financial data, a Python script was created to analyze and calculate the following information:

        1. Total number of months included in the dataset
        2. Net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
        3. Average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period
        4. Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        5. Greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll:
Similar to PyBank, using a csv file containing 3,521,002 rows of data, a Python script was created to analyze the election results of a small rural election to find the following information:

        1. Total number of votes cast
        2. Complete list of candidates who received votes
        3. Percentage of votes each candidate won
        4. Total number of votes each candidate won
        5. Winner of the election based on popular vote

Getting Started:

1. Clone this repo
2. Raw data files in resources folder, output txt file in analysis folder, scripts denoted as main.py
